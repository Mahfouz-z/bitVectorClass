# bitVectorClass
    - This class is a simple memorey efficient implementation
      for a bit array. It allows protected setting and getting
      single bits in an array form.
    gnu complier with c++11 is required
    To compile run:
        make clean
        make all
    Run using:
        ./main
    
    N.B: The class is extended by many debugging statements; however,
    this could be later modified and only use the return values that
    indicate errors. That could be easiy done by using a #ifndef VERBOSE
    statements.
